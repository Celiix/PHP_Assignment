# PHP_Assignment/ DDB (Data Driven Website)

USER PERSPECTIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This PHP sports website project provides a platform for users to browse and select from a variety of sports gear, add items to their shopping cart, view and modify their cart, and complete checkout. Additionally, users can register and log in to the website, allowing them to save items in their cart for future use. In case of any issues, users can communicate with the website's admins via the contact page. The website's user-friendly interface also enables easy login and logout.

ADMIN PERSPECTIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the admin's perspective, the website's dashboard area provides additional tools for managing users and maintaining the website. Admins can view all registered members' information, such as their email, phone number, and name, and have the authority to add or remove users as necessary. The dashboard also allows admins to investigate user queries on the site. Admins are responsible for maintaining the sports gear website and can add, remove, and alter products at any time, with new products automatically added to the database.
